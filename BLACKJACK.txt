BLACKJACK

This program models a casino in which (a) games(s) of blackjack are occuring.
It models the existance of the various tables and their requisite dealers, as well varying numbers of player on each table.
The dealer can perform various functions, such as dealing cards, shuffling the deck, and playing his/her own hand.
The dealer automatically plays in an simplictic optimum manner, as do real dealers.

The players do not automatically play in an optimum manner, although a function can be invoked which automatically
'card counts' and suggests the probabalistically optimum move.

The program uses four classes: table, person, player and dealer. Player and dealer inherit behaviour from person.
The person class is abstract. The player and dealer classes exhibit polymorphic behaviour.
